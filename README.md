# Binary Search
 python program that uses the binary search program 

Binargy search is a divide and conquer algorithim that searches through an ordered list faster rather than scanning every element in a list.
Let's search an order list of values sorted from least to greatest. We first look at the middle index. If our search item is equal return the the index of element.
If it is not we check if it is less than the middle element than if true focus on the first half of the list.
If it is greater than the middle element than we can focus on the second half of the list.

Continue with the same divide and conquer method  until we find the index of the element we want to search.

This makes it much faster to search large lists of data.

we will use a list of 10,000 elements on normal and binary search methods tp finde every element in thos lists and time them.
